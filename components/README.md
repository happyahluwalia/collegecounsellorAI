# Components

## Overview

The components directory contains modular UI and functional components that make up the College Compass application. Each component is designed to handle specific aspects of the user interface and interaction logic.

## Component Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`)
   - Main application interface
   - Activity overview
   - Progress tracking
   - Quick access to key features

2. **Authentication** (`auth.py`)
   - User authentication flow
   - Session management
   - OAuth integration

3. **Chat Interface** (`chat.py`)
   - AI counselor interaction
   - Message history
   - Context management
   - Multi-session support

4. **Profile Management** (`profile.py`)
   - Student information management
   - Academic record tracking
   - Interest and activity logging

5. **College Explorer** (`college_explorer.py`)
   - College database interface
   - Search and filtering
   - Detailed institution information

6. **Achievement System** (`achievements.py`)
   - Progress tracking
   - Milestone recognition
   - Gamification elements

7. **Timeline** (`timeline.py`)
   - Application deadline tracking
   - Milestone management
   - Calendar integration

8. **Internships** (`internships.py`)
   - Internship opportunity tracking
   - Application management
   - Program recommendations

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure
Each component follows a standard structure:
```python
def render_component():
    # Component initialization
    # State management
    # UI rendering
    # Event handling
```

### State Management
- Uses Streamlit session state
- Maintains component-specific data
- Handles cross-component communication

### UI Guidelines
- Consistent styling using utils/constants.py
- Responsive design principles
- Accessible interface elements

## Development Guidelines

1. **Creating New Components**:
   - Follow the established naming convention
   - Include proper documentation
   - Implement error handling
   - Add to __init__.py exports

2. **Component Integration**:
   - Use proper state management
   - Follow UI consistency guidelines
   - Implement proper cleanup

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for component logic
   - Integration tests for component interaction
   - UI testing guidelines

## Future Enhancements

- Enhanced component interaction
- Additional specialized components for:
  - Essay writing assistance
  - Financial aid planning
  - Test preparation
  - Career guidance
