# Tests

## Overview

The tests directory contains the comprehensive test suite for College Compass. Our testing strategy ensures reliability, maintainability, and quality of the application.

## Testing Philosophy

1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
2. Comprehensive Coverage
3. Automated Testing
4. Integration Testing

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests
- Tests individual components
- Mocked dependencies
- Fast execution
- High coverage

### Integration Tests
- Tests component interaction
- Real dependencies
- Database integration
- API integration

### End-to-End Tests
- Full application testing
- User scenarios
- Complete workflows
- Performance testing

## Implementation Details

### Test Structure

```

└── fixtures/            # Test fixtures and data
```

### Test Tools
- PyTest for test execution
- Mock for dependency mocking
- Coverage.py for coverage reporting
- Fixtures for test data

## Current Test Coverage

Key areas covered:
- Chat message parsing
- Database operations
- AI agent interactions
- User authentication
- Achievement system

## Development Guidelines

1. **Writing Tests**:
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Use descriptive names
   - Include edge cases
   - Document complex tests

2. **Test Organization**:
   - Group related tests
   - Use fixtures
   - Maintain test data
   - Clean up after tests

3. **Best Practices**:
   - Write tests first
   - Keep tests focused
   - Use appropriate assertions
   - Handle async operations

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_file.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Coverage Improvements**:
   - Additional integration tests
   - Performance testing
   - Security testing
   - UI testing

2. **Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Automated test runs
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Test result reporting
   - CI/CD integration

## Maintenance Notes

1. Regular tasks:
   - Update test data
   - Review coverage
   - Update documentation
   - Clean up old tests

2. Best practices:
   - Keep tests current
   - Remove obsolete tests
   - Update assertions
   - Maintain fixtures
