# Models

## Overview

This directory contains the core database models and business logic for the College Compass application. The models are designed to provide a clean, maintainable interface between the application and the database.

## Design Philosophy

The models follow these key principles:
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Clean separation of concerns
3. Robust error handling
4. Type safety and validation

## Core Models

### User Model (`user.py`)
- **Purpose**: Manages user authentication and profile data
- **Features**:
  - User creation and retrieval
  - Profile management
  - Chat session tracking
  - Achievement progress

### Achievement Model (`achievement.py`)
- **Purpose**: Handles gamification and progress tracking
- **Features**:
  - Default achievement initialization
  - Progress tracking
  - Requirement evaluation
  - User achievement management

### Database Model (`database.py`)
- **Purpose**: Database connection and query management
- **Features**:
  - Connection pooling
  - Transaction management
  - Error handling
  - Query execution

## Implementation Details

### Database Interaction
- Uses connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Implements prepared statements for security
- Provides transaction management utilities
- Includes robust error handling and logging

### Data Validation
- Input validation before database operations
- Type checking and conversion
- Error states and recovery
- Constraint enforcement

### Error Handling
- Custom exception classes
- Detailed error logging
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Graceful degradation

## Usage Examples

### User Operations
```python
# Create a new user
user = User(email="example@email.com", name="Example User")
user.create()

# Update user profile
user.update_profile(
    gpa=3.8,
    interests=["Computer Science", "Mathematics"],
    activities=["Robotics Club", "Chess Team"]
)
```

### Achievement Operations
```python
# Check achievement progress
achievement = Achievement.get_by_id(achievement_id)
progress = achievement.check_progress(user_id, current_state)

# Get user achievements
achievements = Achievement.get_user_achievements(user_id)
```

## Development Guidelines

1. **Adding New Models**:
   - Inherit from appropriate base classes
   - Implement required interfaces
   - Add comprehensive documentation
   - Include type hints

2. **Database Operations**:
   - Use prepared statements
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Include transaction management
   - Add appropriate indices

3. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for model logic
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - Mock database for testing
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Query optimization
   - Caching implementation
   - Bulk operation support

2. **Additional Features**:
   - Enhanced validation
   - Audit logging
   - Version tracking
   - Soft delete support

## Maintenance Notes

1. All models include:
   - Created/updated timestamps
   - Proper indexing
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Validation methods

2. Regular maintenance tasks:
   - Index optimization
   - Query performance monitoring
   - Schema updates via migrations
   - Data integrity checks
