We believe customer satisfaction is only a minimum requirement. We seek therefore not merely to satisfy our students, but to empower them to make significant changes in their lives, changes our student's desire and deserve.  We believe this empowerment comes from a unique educational process in which every Alaska Career College employee works toward the success of every student.    This unique commitment to the education of our students by the faculty and staff of Alaska Career College means giving our students dramatically more value than they expect -- whether that value is measured by performance, quality, tuition cost, features, or service. We know we are succeeding when we inspire our students not simply to accept the minimum standards, but to invest in themselves and their education.  We seek not merely to provide the minimum requirements in career education; we seek to teach the skills necessary to help our graduates begin their careers.    The programs we offer at Alaska Career College are neither the shortest nor the least expensive, but we believe they are the best.  The education we provide our students is well worth the extra commitment on their part and ours. We believe this commitment to be the true worth of our philosophy and mission.","0",,,,,,"Under 1,000","Alaska","Private for-profit, 2-year","Private for-profit","60",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We continually survey the profession to keep abreast of current trends, designs, and techniques required by employers. Teachers give “individual” as well as “class” instruction. This combination helps serious students to realize their goals. Both academic and career standards are maintained to assure graduates are capable in their profession. The curriculum is flexible enough to allow for new procedures and techniques as they are developed, yet solid enough to maintain high academic standards. The final objective is, of course, to graduate students who will secure and retain employment and advance in their profession.","0",,,,,,"Under 1,000","California","Private for-profit, less-than 2-year","Private for-profit","82",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to fulfill our objective, we not only teach the techniques and artistry of cosmetology, barbering, esthetics and manicuring, we also teach poise, charm, self-reliance, business practices, and personal hygiene. We continually survey the profession to keep abreast of current trends, designs and techniques required by employers. Teachers give individual as well as class instruction. This combination helps serious students realize their goals.  Academic and career standards are maintained to assure graduates of capability in their profession. The curriculum is flexible enough to allow for new procedures and techniques as they are developed yet solid enough to maintain academic standards. The final objective is, of course, to graduate students who will secure and retain employment and advance their profession.","100",,,,,,"Under 1,000","California","Private for-profit, less-than 2-year","Private for-profit","100",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assist all students in achieving a superior level of basic skills for an entry-level veterinary technician.  2. To instill in each student the means of developing a professional appearance, poise and a continuing pattern for self-improvement.  3.

The program of learning embraces not only the esoteric theory and concepts embodied in the Talmud and the practical Halachic (legal) principles that are derived from the Talmud, but also the Torah Hashkafa, or ethical and moral values and imperatives critical to individual and interpersonal growth.

It is committed to the advancement of Jewish scholarship by serving the educational needs of its geographic area, as well as the greater community of interested students. At the center of our program lies the principle that education is a lifelong process for which we seek to prepare our students. Education at Telshe is not geared only to training graduates to qualify for a job. The Yeshiva program is designed to shape the way students think and, because the ultimate test of philosophy is practical action, how the way they live. 	 The process of study at Telshe Yeshiva Chicago is not different in its essentials from the curriculum developed centuries ago in the Talmudic academies of Eastern Europe, and prior to that in the Torah centers of the Middle East. One goal of this education is to provide a generous awareness of Jewish belief, culture, and history; another is to make it relevant to contemporary life. Specific academic objectives vary with the individual student. For the scholar, our purpose is to challenge him to creative virtuosity; for the future rabbi our aim is to equip him with a knowledge of law and its process so that he can function as an informed leader and judge; for the student who will choose neither of these fields, we seek to provide the foundation for living a Jewish life based on creative interaction with Torah teachings.","100","125",,,"100","15000","Under 1,000","Illinois","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","97",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","19","19","0","19","19",,"100",,

Such education seeks to free human beings from prejudice and unexamined opinion, to help them reflect on the nature of things and on the ends and means of human endeavors, to prepare them to meet the known and unknown challenges the future will present, and to enable them to make thoughtful choices in public and private life. Students at St. John's engage in this education by participating in the activities of its community of learning. The central activity is the reading and discussion, in small classes, of the great works of the West. This study is supported by and intertwined with the study of the elements of languages, mathematics, science, and music. In Santa Fe there is also a program that focuses on the great works of the East. Through this singular discussion-based classroom experience, anchored in the rigor of the subject matters, we seek to develop in our students an ability to deal with complex issues through both cooperative inquiry and independent thinking. We hope to open the world to them in such a way that they become excellent citizens, parents, partners, colleagues, and friends.","0","372","7340","7644","44","39126","Under 1,000","Maryland","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","92",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted (Test Optional)","1059","518","541","469","206","263","44","760","740"

As a research university, Brandeis is dedicated to the advancement of the humanities, arts and social, natural and physical sciences. As a liberal arts college, Brandeis affirms the importance of a broad and critical education in enriching the lives of students and preparing them for full participation in a changing society, capable of promoting their own welfare, yet remaining deeply concerned about the welfare of others.  In a world of challenging social and technological transformations, Brandeis remains a center of open inquiry and teaching, cherishing its independence from any doctrine or government. It strives to reflect the heterogeneity of the United States and of the world community whose ideas and concerns it shares. In the belief that the most important learning derives from the personal encounter and joint work of teacher and students, Brandeis encourages undergraduates and postgraduates to participate with distinguished faculty in research, scholarship and artistic activities.  Brandeis was founded in 1948 as a nonsectarian university under the sponsorship of the American Jewish community to embody its highest ethical and cultural values and to express its gratitude to the United States through the traditional Jewish commitment to education.

The centrality of Torah study as the sine qua non of the Jewish experience is the underlying tenet on which the Shaarei Yosher education program is predicated. Mastery of the Talmud in a yeshiva setting has been widely accepted as the preferred method for the development of an accomplished Talmid Chacham, a Jewish scholar of stature. Intense study of the Talmud and its commentaries is the primary goal of the academic programs at Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute. Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute seeks to inculcate its students with a broad understanding of Talmudic knowledge as well as the analytical skills needed to plunge the depths of Torah scholarship.  A student at Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute is expected to immerse himself into the depth of Torah learning, with an emphasis on the Talmud. He is further expected to demonstrate a personal commitment to Torah study, which will result in a lifelong pursuit of Torah learning. The emphasis of the academic program on Talmudic study requires students to spend a major portion of their day engrossed in the study of the Talmud. In addition to the student's intellectual growth as a scholar, Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute also focuses on his moral and ethical development. To this end, Beth Hamedrash Shaarei Yosher Institute promotes the study of Mussar, or Ethics, based on the Aggadic sections of the Talmud, as well as classical literature of the last several hundred years exploring the philosophical and moral imperatives in ethical human behavior.","0",,,"2150","90","12000","Under 1,000","New York","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","84",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","31","31","0","28","28",,"90",,

Integral to these general goals is that all graduates be well acquainted with the unique Chabad perspective on all aspects of life.

The college's current mission is to educate today's diverse students with fairness and compassion while equipping them with the practical and professional skills needed for success in their future careers. The college fulfills this mission by offering degree and non-degree programs that develop professional competencies for business careers and provide a general education to contribute to the intellectual and emotional growth of each student.  The various programs meet student needs and the demands of the area community.  The measure of the college's success will be evidenced by the success of its graduates in finding relevant employment; by the partnerships the college has forged with the business community; and by the opportunities available to students interested in pursuing additional education.  Jamestown Business College is dedicated to the belief that its programs should not only prepare students to enter the workforce but also to take part fully in today's society.  The college offers general education courses to assist students to think logically and critically, to improve their communication skills, to achieve self-knowledge, to work cooperatively in teams, and to develop an appreciation of life-long learning.  All of these are essential skills for graduates to possess in our rapidly changing society and increasingly complex workplace.  All students are encouraged by the faculty and staff to achieve their academic and personal potential.  To accomplish this, the college provides a supportive environment in which students have access to a range of academic, personal, and career services.","25",,,,"86","12945","Under 1,000","New York","Private for-profit, 4-year or above","Private for-profit","96",,"Not considered for admission, even if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","134","36","98","115","30","85","86",,

Young men, born and raised in all parts of the United States and Canada, South and Central America, Europe, Africa and Israel, arrive on campus with various backgrounds, but with a common desire to attain a high level of Talmudic Scholarship, as well as the inherent ability to cope with a demanding program of studies.  In the years that these people will spend at the College, it is expected that they will develop habits of scholarship, techniques of independent research, and most essential, a love of learning which will stand them in good stead throughout their lives.  There is another objective that has always been part of the Telshe Yeshiva; a graduate must possess those qualities of character and mind which mark him as being a concerned, involved member of the Jewish community, and a productive member of society as a whole. Leadership in community affairs, education and in civic matters has always been the hallmark of the Telshe graduate - in addition to the world - renowned scholarship of so many of its former students.","100","300","1000","2000","81","17900","Under 1,000","Ohio","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","74",,"Not considered for admission, even if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not considered for admission, even if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","36","36","0","29","29",,"81",,

From a practical point of view this philosophy indicates that, since learning takes place within the student, the school is dedicated to helping the student learn. Further, since the school is sensitive to the student's ultimate objective, employment, and employers' needs, learning involves not only technical information, but the other qualities and attitudes that develop the total human being. Thus, the student is made aware of the need for self discipline, neat appearance, clear and concise writing, confident speech, cooperation, honesty, and the many other characteristics that the employer finds desirable in a good employee.","100","16","4800",,,,"Under 1,000","Pennsylvania","Private for-profit, 2-year","Private for-profit","71",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seeks to liberate and nurture the individuality, the creative intelligence, and the ethical and aesthetic sensibility of its students, to the end that their richly varied natural endowments will be directed toward self-fulfillment and toward constructive social purposes. We believe that these educational goals are best served by demanding of our students active participation in the planning of their own programs, and in the regulation of their own lives on campus. Student freedom is not the absence of restraint, however; it is rather the fullest possible substitution of habits of self-restraint for restraint imposed by others. The exercise of student freedom is the very condition of a meaningful education, and an essential aspect of the nurture of free citizens, dedicated to civilized values and capable of creative and constructive membership in modern society.","0","799","10120","8520","48","64644","Under 1,000","Vermont","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","98",,"Required to be considered for admission","Required to be considered for admission","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted (Test Optional)","2825","1031","1793","1357","308","1049","48","740","673"

Additionally, the Yeshiva Gedolah trains students to think independently by conceptualizing many passages together, with his own abilities to comprehend the various texts as they are presented. Most important to the ben Torah is the study of mussar, personal ethics, and the development of the human spirit. This is fundamental to the growth of any student who pursues his studies within this school. Mussar is a foundation upon which a ben Torah is built.  A key objective of the Yeshiva Gedolah program is to develop within the student the ability to analyze and compare issues, researching the existing literature, searching for apparent inconsistencies or difficulties, and then attempting to resolve them. The Yeshiva Gedolah feels that these qualities are necessary for proper and honest approaches to both Torah and mussar. Lectures are given with the modus operandi of "Let the wise one listen and add from within himself”. This is a unique style of teaching which encourages the student to think clearly and decipher issues with the end result of developing in the students this ability to independently compare issues and resolve them. The student is taught to take apart and build at the same time; to ask honest questions and to give honest answers; to decide which issues can be compared and which cannot; which can possibly be answered with a new and innovative approach. The Yeshiva Gedolah works diligently to develop each and every student into the complete man, embodied with both intelligence and refined character.","0","70","2350","2650","93","8600","Under 1,000","Michigan","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","81",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","27","27","0","25","25",,"93",,

The Licensed Practical Nursing Program originally licensed by the New York State Education Department in 1963, provides residents of Nassau County and surrounding communities with an opportunity to acquire knowledge and skills needed to gain entry-level employment in health career occupations. It maintains accreditation from the New York State Education Department.  Since its inception, the LPN Program has trained thousands of Licensed Practical Nurses.  The Program is specifically designed for adult learners and has established an excellent reputation as a quality training institution.   The VEEB program provides an essential path for a diverse population of adult learners to become contributing members in the County’s health care delivery system.  The LPN program operates as a tuition-based school.  Eligible students qualify for Federal Education Grants (PELL) and/or guaranteed or subsidized student loans.  After completing the first of three semesters, students are eligible to take Nursing Assistant Exam and thus qualify for entry-level employment while completing semesters two and three of the LPN program.

Additionally, upon completion of our program, the students should be well-equipped - both intellectually and practically - to face the challenges of the day. Ultimately, our vision is to develop an institution which will prepare the groundwork for the next generation of followers of the Torah.   The main objective of our program is to bring out the best in our students so they will fulfill their potential. In Yeshiva of the Telshe Alumni, this is not merely some cliché bandied about. It is a fundamental building block in the structure of the Yeshiva, and it guides the Rosh HaYeshiva and the faculty in their day-to-day interaction with students.   Another objective is to present a challenging program of study to the more gifted student who wants to make a career of Talmudic research.

Nowhere is this illustrated better than by the Rosh HaYeshiva, Rabbi Yaakov Bender. Rabbi Bender delivers a lecture to youngsters in preschool, then to boys in the elementary school, junior high, high school and finally the Beis Medrash. Each hears the same basic lesson presented on a different level. The point is to educate students on proper character traits and infuse them with the concept of assisting others. Kind acts can occur through the Gemara. It is one thing to ‘preach’ kindness, in this Yeshiva; we ‘act’ on it.","0","150",,,"70","10040","Under 1,000","New York","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","48",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","120","120","0","84","84",,"70",,

The Campus' philosophy is to provide quality programs that are sound in concept, implemented by a competent and dedicated faculty, and geared to serve those seeking a solid foundation in knowledge and skills required to gain employment in their chosen fields. The programs emphasize 'hands on' training and are designed to meet the needs of employers in today's market. To offer students the training and skills that will lead to successful employment, the school must:    - continually evaluate and update educational programs,    - provide modern facilities and training equipment,    - select instructors with professional experience in the vocations they teach with the ability to motivate and develop students to their greatest potential, and    - encourage self-discipline so that students may enjoy success on the job and in society.","0",,,,,"23560","Under 1,000","Louisiana","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","96",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the most gifted students, this means helping them become genuine Torah scholars who are not only capable of mastering the individual Mesachtas included in the curriculum, but also of joining the community of scholars who are solely devoted to Torah learning. For those who are not so inclined, the program aims to equip them with the requisite logical and analytical skills for lifelong and independent learning, with an appreciation of the singular importance of Talmudic study.    Another component of the mission is to provide the training needed to live a Torah life.

With a mission to provide an intensive and rigorous program of classical Talmudic Studies and related fields, the yeshiva aims to educate its students in the methods and skills needed to study Talmud independently.   For some students, this program will provide the necessary tools to become genuine Talmidei Chachomim (Torah scholars), who possess the ability to master many Talmudic Tractates. This will enable them to join other scholars who are solely devoted to Torah learning. For other students, the program will equip them with the requisite logical and analytical skills for lifelong independent learning in conjunction with an appreciation of the importance of Talmudic study.    An overall important component to this mission is to train students to live a Torah life by incorporating the study of Mussar (Jewish Ethical and Philosophical texts), while providing the appropriate role models. Including the study of important Halacha (Jewish Legal Codes) literature that defines the parameters of the Orthodox Jewish lifestyle in the curriculum is an significant element as well.  Aside from developing productive members of the community and larger society in this manner, Yeshiva Gedolah Shaarei Shmuel provides the academic training needed by the students to enter advanced Talmudic programs both in America and Israel.","0","90","1400","1400","53","9720","Under 1,000","New Jersey","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","88",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","100","100","0","53","53",,"53",,

Until now, a student’s exposure to Talmud learning was limited - based almost exclusively on the lectures of his instructors. In contrast, the postsecondary experience at Yeshivas Emek Hatorah extends further, seeking to develop the student’s personal thinking process, combined with the analysis of the Talmudic decisions and discussions. Hence, the student is challenged to apply his own reasoning and knowledge in order to grasp the inner-meaning behind a legal opinion or decision found in the Talmud.   Although this emphasis on learning and reasoning is a major component of Yeshivas Emek Hatorah, it is by no means the only one. Striving to create a well-rounded student, imbued with a sense of responsibility towards the community, the Yeshiva places an equally important role on developing moral and ethical character.   With the firm philosophy that its multi-faceted objective can only be attained through a positive, accepting atmosphere, the Yeshiva fosters a warm environment, allowing students to utilize their unique potentials to the fullest. Moreover, Yeshivas Emek Hatorah’s faculty members serve as a tremendous inspiration and encouragement to the students. Indeed, the close connection that is developed, amid warm guidance, benefits the students and furthers their gains in academic and character excellence.","0","100",,,"100","9750","Under 1,000","New Jersey","Private not-for-profit, 4-year or above","Private not-for-profit","57",,"Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Required to be considered for admission","Not required for admission, but considered if submitted","Not considered for admission, even if submitted (Test Blind)","29","29","0","29","29",,"100",,

Furthermore, we prepare graduates to integrate themselves into the healing arts community, the medical community, and the community at large, to promote societal change from the individual outward. We seek to integrate each person into the rhythms of nature and their own life rhythms, and we promote a social structure and healthcare model that supports this integration.
